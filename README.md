# Melodix

Melodix is a premium, modern, and highly customized Terminal User Interface (TUI) music player for Linux, built using Python's modern **Textual** framework and powered by the **mpv** audio engine via IPC sockets. It is designed to match system monitors like `btop` with a rich **Gruvbox dark** theme, rounded panel layouts, transparent background integration, and a custom procedural audio visualizer.

##  Features

- **Terminal Transparency Integration**: Complete `ansi_default` background architecture, allowing your native terminal wallpaper/opacity to shine directly through the panels.
- **Interactive File Library**: Tree-based navigation starting in `~/Music` by default. Hitting `Enter` on any audio file instantly appends it to the active queue.
- **Procedural Spectrum Visualizer**:
  - Vertical color gradients matching the btop graph look.
  - Textured gradient animations using shaded block characters (`░`, `▒`, `▓`, `█`).
  - Dynamic diagonal highlights (`╱`) and white glow sheens.
- **Robust IPC Backend**: Controls a background-spawned `mpv` process asynchronously using standard JSON-RPC command sockets.
- **Keyboard & Mouse Friendly**: Complete hotkeys for mouse-free operation, plus clickable transport and volume controls.
- **Fully Packaged**: Modern PEP-517 setup via `pyproject.toml` for standard system installations.
