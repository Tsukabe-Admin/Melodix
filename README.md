# 󰓎 Melodix

Melodix is a premium, modern, and highly customized Terminal User Interface (TUI) music player for Linux, built using Python's modern **Textual** framework and powered by the **mpv** audio engine via IPC sockets. It is designed to match system monitors like `btop` with a rich **Gruvbox dark** theme, rounded panel layouts, transparent background integration, and a custom procedural audio visualizer.

## ✨ Features

- **Terminal Transparency Integration**: Complete `ansi_default` background architecture, allowing your native terminal wallpaper/opacity to shine directly through the panels.
- **btop Aesthetic**: Dense grid layouts, color-coded sections (Blue for Library, Yellow for Queue, Orange for Controls), and rounded corner styles (`border: round`).
- **Interactive File Library**: Tree-based navigation starting in `~/Music` by default. Hitting `Enter` on any audio file instantly appends it to the active queue.
- **Procedural Spectrum Visualizer**:
  - Vertical color gradients matching the btop graph look.
  - Textured gradient animations using shaded block characters (`░`, `▒`, `▓`, `█`).
  - Dynamic diagonal highlights (`╱`) and white glow sheens.
- **Robust IPC Backend**: Controls a background-spawned `mpv` process asynchronously using standard JSON-RPC command sockets.
- **Keyboard & Mouse Friendly**: Complete hotkeys for mouse-free operation, plus clickable transport and volume controls.
- **Fully Packaged**: Modern PEP-517 setup via `pyproject.toml` for standard system installations.

## 🛠 Architecture

- **`main.py`**: The entrypoint and Textual App controller. Manages UI mounts, event loops, reactive properties, and links keys to player actions.
- **`player.py`**: The background controller. Spawns `mpv --idle` and connects via standard UNIX socket IPC. Sends serialized JSON commands and reads messages in an independent background thread.
- **`visualizer.py`**: Renders the spectrum graph using overlapping mathematical wave expressions scaled in real-time by volume and pause state.
- **`styles.css`**: Textual CSS styling sheet describing panel layouts, Gruvbox theme tokens, and transparency settings.
